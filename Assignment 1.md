# Case Study For Stripe Inc

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?\
        
        Stripe Inc
* When was the company incorporated?\
        
        Stripe, Inc. was incorporated on September 23, 2010.
* Who are the founders of the company?\
        
        Stripe was founded by two brothers, Patrick Collison and John Collison.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?\

    >John and Patrick first started working on Stripe in early 2010.  The inspiration came when Patrick, who was working on a few side projects, kept complaining about how difficult it was to accept payments on the web.  The two quickly developed a simple solution and within 2-weeks they had processed their first transaction.  Over the next 6-months they showed it to friends, watched people interact with it, and iterated as fast as they could.
    In the beginning they weren’t sure how big the market was or whether they could accomplish their goal of addressing issues like fraud and non-US payments in a user-friendly way.  They originally partnered with a payments company, but quickly realized that the only way to control the entire experience was to control all aspects of the process. That’s when they brought everything in house.
By the fall of 2010, Stripe had become their full-time jobs.  They thought about bootstrapping it, as they had to that point, but soon realized that as a payment startup they would need the kind of institutional credibility that only a top-notch investor could provide.


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?\

        Stripe has secured significant funding through various rounds of financing. Stripe has raised a total of $8.7B in funding over 20 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Apr 25, 2023 from a Grant round. Stripe is funded by 57 investors.
